## Install

Install the official runtime with Node.js:

```sh
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web
```

Install an external profile bundle with pnpm on your `PATH`:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add "github:owner/repo#ref"
```

`dsh plugin` forwards package operations to pnpm, so npm, Git/GitHub, local path, `file:` and `link:` package specs are supported. Only packages declaring `dsh.bundle.patch` become active profile layers; plain dependencies remain installed but inactive. Restart `dsh --profile web` after installing or updating a bundle.

The former `&path:` sub-path and Repository Plugin installation forms are not part of the current official bundle flow; use an installable package that declares `dsh.bundle.patch`.

Management panel: Settings → Plugins.

- [timwhitez/dsh-self-evolving](https://github.com/timwhitez/dsh-self-evolving) - Evidence-first, crash-resumable self-evolution engine for DSH: generates bounded Cordis plugin candidates, admits them through a one-shot real Loader, evaluates with Harbor, and journals an auditable lineage.

- [bpc-oss/dsh-fork-to-preset](https://github.com/bpc-oss/dsh-fork-to-preset) - Fork any session into a different agent preset from the conversation header: a preset picker creates a new child session mounted on the chosen preset, inheriting the source session's completed turns.
- [qwert702/dsh-commander](https://github.com/qwert702/dsh-commander) - Commander mode for DSH Web: inject protocol briefs into the session title bar, parse task blocks from model replies and auto-execute them, separating strategy from execution; activated via a badge button.

- [dsh-llm-local-token](https://github.com/tianxia--/dsh-llm-local-token) - Reuse the OAuth credentials your local Codex CLI and Claude Code already hold: registers `openai-codex` and `anthropic` routes read from `~/.codex/auth.json` and `~/.claude/.credentials.json` (macOS Keychain fallback), refreshes tokens near expiry, and reports subscription usage from provider rate-limit headers.
- [loongport-dsh](https://github.com/SailingLoong/loongport-dsh) - Multi-site relay provider setup: signed provider directory (identity, URLs, models), Settings → LoongPort page for provider and manual API key configuration, OpenAI-compatible routes (npm: loongport).

- [rapid-mlx-dsh-provider](https://github.com/raullenchai/rapid-mlx-dsh-provider) - Native provider for Rapid-MLX, an Apple-silicon local inference server: registers a `rapid-mlx` LlmAdapter route that reads model facts (context window, reasoning parser, capabilities) from the server's `/v1/models` instead of a hand-written settings.yaml, so switching served models needs no re-setup and compaction is timed to the real context window.
- [dsh-llm-gate](https://github.com/d3vmeh/dsh-llm-gate) - Per-provider concurrency gate on the llm/stream waterfall: holds surplus model requests in a FIFO queue inside DSH so main agent, subagents and compaction take turns on a single-slot local server (llama.cpp --parallel 1) instead of timing out; maxConcurrent / maxQueued / queueTimeoutMs.

- [dsh-plugin-rollout-scout](https://github.com/SpookySandwich/dsh-plugin-rollout-scout) - Detects which conversation model your account is being served: launches concurrent throwaway probe conversations, scores each streaming chain-of-thought by how its paragraphs open, and cancels probes that read as the older model within seconds.
- [openllmsh/dsh](https://github.com/openllmsh/dsh) - Routes the harness through the OpenLLM gateway: a pure-config Cordis patch that adds an `openllm` provider to the in-box pi-ai adapter pointed at the local daemon (`127.0.0.1:8787/v1`, no API key held by dsh) and registers the `openllm mcp` stdio server (openllm, claude-context, supermemory tool groups).
- [lynkr-dsh-plugin](https://github.com/veerareddyvishal144/lynkr-dsh-plugin) - Registers Lynkr, a self-hosted tier-routing LLM gateway, as a custom OpenAI-compatible provider: classifies each request's difficulty and routes it to the cheapest model that can handle it, across 15+ providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Azure, Bedrock, Vertex, OpenRouter, Ollama, DeepSeek, and more).
- [dsh-fetch-timeouts](https://github.com/d3vmeh/dsh-fetch-timeouts) - Raises Node's HTTP headers/body timeouts for the whole DSH process (default 30 min, proxy-aware) so Ollama and LM Studio models that stay silent while thinking or generating a large tool call are not cut off at 5 minutes; replaces the node_modules undici patch.
- [dsh-turn-doctor](https://github.com/d3vmeh/dsh-turn-doctor) - Explains which layer killed a failed turn: times every model request (first byte, longest silence, total) and combines that with the error to name the culprit (dsh idle watchdog vs Node undici timers vs SDK timer vs server crash, context overflow, gate queue, tool timeouts, failed compactions) and the exact setting to change; verdicts in the DSH terminal plus a /why command, subagents included.
- [dsh-logbook](https://github.com/d3vmeh/dsh-logbook) - Makes ctx.logger output visible: a /logs chat command over a full-capture ring (level, name, grep, since filters) plus a default-on stderr exporter for warnings and errors, configurable per plugin; works headless. Also documents that dsh's default log buffer silently drops warn and debug records.
- [dsh-model-pin](https://github.com/d3vmeh/dsh-model-pin) - Keeps every model request inside a per-provider allow-list, enforced at the agent/request waterfall: disallowed models are redirected to a fallback or refused; subagents stop inheriting stale creation-time routes; warns when consecutive requests would make a --models-max 1 llama.cpp router reload models. A one-entry list is a global single-model mode.
- [dsh-think-ultra](https://github.com/YUEYUEXYS/dsh-think-ultra) - Pins every request to native `max` reasoning effort instead of the `ultra` option, with isolated Flash / Pro / Vision depth presets. Distributed as a build-only artifact: the core is closed and its license forbids reverse-engineering, deobfuscation and repackaging.
- [Zn-Dk/dsh-zhipu-toolkit](https://github.com/Zn-Dk/dsh-zhipu-toolkit) - Dual-endpoint Zhipu BigModel GLM provider catalog (Coding Plan + ordinary API) with live model discovery, live-tested thinking-tier mapping, and a settings card for keys, endpoints, the default reasoning tier, and local API key support (key stored in the DSH credential store).
- [dsh-oh-my-claude](https://github.com/lcestou/dsh-oh-my-claude) - Claude Code CLI as a model provider for DSH: runs the logged-in CLI over stream-json at subscription price, with the live model list, per-session resume, permission prompts relayed into the access shield, images, an MCP bridge to dsh tools, and workspaces on remote SSH boxes.
